Lie Detection and Sentiment Classification with Text Mining

Problem Statement:
In this project, we aim to investigate the claim that machine learning algorithms can effectively determine whether a person is lying or not. To test this claim, we have curated a dataset consisting of customer reviews, some of which are true and others that are false. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in detecting fake reviews. Additionally, we will compare the performance of NB and SVMs in sentiment classification.

The dataset contains customer reviews, each labeled with a sentiment (positive or negative) and an indication of whether the review is true or false. Our goal is to leverage text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately classify the reviews as either true or false, as well as determine their sentiment.

To achieve this, we will explore various tuning parameters for NB and SVMs, experimenting with different configurations. We will carefully evaluate the performance of each model and select the best-performing model for each algorithm. The evaluation results will be presented in a tabular format, providing a comprehensive comparison of the performance metrics for the top-performing NB and SVM models.

By examining the performance of NB and SVMs in both lie detection and sentiment classification tasks, we aim to gain insights into the effectiveness of these algorithms in distinguishing between true and false reviews, as well as accurately classifying sentiment. The findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of machine learning algorithms in the context of lie detection and sentiment analysis, potentially shedding light on the credibility of such claims in practice.
